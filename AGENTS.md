# Repository Guidelines

This repository contains a small React portal located in `dev-web`.

* Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `npm ci`) inside `dev-web` if `node_modules` is missing.
* Always run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` within `dev-web` before committing any changes.
* Keep commit messages short and written in the present tense.
* PR summaries should mention important file changes and cite lines from the repo.
* Do not commit binary images (png, jpeg, etc.).
